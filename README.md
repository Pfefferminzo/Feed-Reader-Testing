# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! 

## Installation

If you want to start the site just click on the index.html and the site will open. At the bottom you can see the unit tests and in the center the main page
